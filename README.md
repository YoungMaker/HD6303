HD6303 powered minicomputer. With the help of @daveho I'm dialing it back to 1989


About the HD6303RP
It's an 8 bit CPU that supports an extended version of the Motorola 6800 instruction set.

Because it has some built-in peripherals (timer, UART) and 128 bytes of internal RAM, it could be considered a microcontroller. However, it has no internal program memory, and code must be run from an external ROM.
